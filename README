 Imgur Image Upload library for Arduino

 What is it?
 -----------
 This lib lets you upload pictures with your Arduino. Pictures are uploaded
 to Imgur.com. Imgur.com is an image store just like TwitPic. 
 It is an adoption of the TwitPic lib by arms22 http://code.google.com/p/arms22/
 It requires a WiFly or Ethernet shield.


 Install
 -------
 Copy the Imgur directory to your Arduino/libraries directory.


 How to?
 -------
 1. Go to Imgur.com and acquire an application key.
 2. Open the Imgur example. Insert the application key.
 3. Adopt the settings for the WiFly shield to your needs. The Ethernet
    shield should work with minimal changes as well, but I haven't tested
    that.
 4. Start the sketch. Open the terminal. Wait until it displays the image
    URL. Check for the image at Imgur.com.
 5. Have fun!
